# HYT939

This sensor is not for everyone because of it’s high cost, but if you need the best of the best Temperature and Humidity Sensor money can buy, look no further as few sensors can compare to this gem. Precisely calibrated, the HYT939 delivers an accuracy of ±1.8 % RH and ±0.2 °C. Integrated signal processing is used for measuring the physical parameters of relative humidity and temperature using a convenient I2C interface.
